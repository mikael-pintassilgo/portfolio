Hi!

My name is Mikhail Shchegolkov.
I work for a company developing an ERP system for small and medium businesses.
I analyze interfaces, user behavior, product metrics, and assist my fellow developers as a product manager.

Here I publish projects that I have completed on ERP system development projects, as well as my own projects and projects at the universities where I studied.

For projects I completed for a company developing ERP solutions, I publish the generated data to protect the company's and its clients' information.

For my pet projects and the projects I completed at university, I try to write as detailed reports as possible so that I can improve them in the future or use them in other projects, as well as for educational purposes and as a contribution to community development.

The most interesting projects:
- [A/B testing of a new product form design in an ERP system](https://github.com/mikael-pintassilgo/portfolio/blob/main/colab-notebooks/AB_test_of_a_product_form_redesign.ipynb)
