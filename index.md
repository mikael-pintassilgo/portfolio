title: Welcome to my portfolio

Here I publish projects I completed for a company developing an ERP solution for businesses, as well as pet projects and projects at the universities where I studied.

For projects I completed for a company developing ERP solutions, I publish the generated data to protect the company's and its clients' information.

For my pet projects and the projects I completed at university, I try to write as detailed reports as possible so that I can improve them in the future or use them in other projects, as well as for educational purposes and as a contribution to community development.
