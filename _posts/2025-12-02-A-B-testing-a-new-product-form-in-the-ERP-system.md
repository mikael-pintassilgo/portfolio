Plan
- Create an MVP of the recommendation system.
- Conduct hallway usability tests.
- Conduct A/B testing on a subset of our users.
- If during the A/B testing we see a statistically significant improvement in the key metric (number of order lines) and no deterioration in other metrics (see below), we will conduct usability testing.
- Expand the recommendation system to all users.
- Make a marketing project with the marketing team.
- Analysis of the marketing project results.
